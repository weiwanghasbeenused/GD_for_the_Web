This website serves as an informational site teaching people how to create a strong password. Generally, passwords are more than just a combination of letters, numbers, and marks because they also leave a strong impression in people's memories. Considering this fact, I am also curious to see what people will come up with, by displaying people's password on the website after they submit them. The blurriness of a password represents how strong it is.
