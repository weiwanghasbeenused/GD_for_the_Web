Pinterest is known for providing inspirations for people working in creative industry. However, these inspirations are mostly visual elements–form, color, and typography. This chrome extension functions as another kind of inspiration–what is going on in the real world–by substituting all the images on Pinterest with headlines from New York Times website. These events should also inspire designers to make something reacting to the world.
